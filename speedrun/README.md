# Speedrun

These problems are not particularly hard. However, coming up with a solution in a short amount of time for them, especially under pressure, is not as easy when you don't have practice. The ideal way I view attempting these problems is in your favourite programming language with a timer, the goal being to optimize the time spent on solving it as much as possible. I believe doing such problems regularly does improve sharpness and intuition, as well as confidence in stressful situations and builds to an overall better solving experience.
