# Welcome!

If you want more problems in your life, you've come to the right place 😶

This repository contains implementation of coding problems from various places, including contests, interviews (that I participated personally at or that I found online), problem solving websites, my own problems, math, famous ideas etc. I've tried to group them the best I could, but there likely are some duplicates or some odd ones. 

I don't really have a language preference, most are in Go since I'm the most familiar with, but I'm looking forward to migrate to C (or even assembly). Usually for coding problems, I encourage using the language you're most familiar with, since the aim is to have a clear understanding of the problem itself and the ideas it presents, without the ins and outs of the language.

## Summary

Here's the structure of this repository:

- [`Advent of code 2022`](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms/tree/master/advent-of-code-2022) has my solutions for the [2022 Advent of Code contest](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
- [`interviews`](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms/tree/master/interviews) contains a list of problems I collected from coding interviews 🗓️
- [`leetcode`](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms/tree/master/leetcode) contains solutions of problems I solved from leetcode
- [`math-stuff`](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms/tree/master/math-stuff) contains more "math-y" stuff (you probably don't want to look there 😒)
- [`speedrun`](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms/tree/master/speedrun) contains fairly easy problems that you should solve quickly under serious pressure	⏲️

## Have fun! 🥳
