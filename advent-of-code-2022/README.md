# Advent of Code 2022

Welcome! üññ

This year, I decided to attempt the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) contest. I've heard about it from a friend, who basically told me that one problem gets published every day for 25 days and that they're not too difficult. I've never really been into competitive programming, but I was always attracted to problem solving, which I didn't really have that much time for. The idea of the contest was really intriguing to be, and after reading the first two problems I decided to challenge myself to solve all problems during the 25 days, every day after work and university.

This has turned out to be quite a ride. At first, the problems were fairly easy, and I just had to get used to writing the algorithms. I went with Go as the programming language, since I'm a Go programmer. Once I got in shape by solving the first two or three problems, it took me 20-30 minutes to solve the easier ones, but the difficulty kept increasing and I even ended up spending hours (sometimes even in different days) on some problems. I must say, sometimes after the 16th day, not exactly sure which one, there were times where I felt it was a bit overwhelming and that I was spending too much time on the problems, and was wondering if I was going to be able to complete all of them. 

In the end, I believe this was very beneficial to me, and even though it cost me some hangouts with friends and Friday nights (I think somewhere around 30 hours of work to solve all these problems), I'm glad I did it. I feel that I have much more control over the fundamental algorithms and my code writing speed has increased significantly. I was also able to improve my Go skills via this challenge, so every hour spend past 12 a.m. to grind these problems was worth it. It brought back the joy of getting a problem right back from the old college days when I was doing math contests, and I have to admit that the last day when I finally got the only problem I had remaining right, problem 19, I was so delighted ü•≥! I would gladly recommend this contest to anybody, really (although some prior basic algorithms and data structures knowlledge would be an enormous benefit).

On a related note, I never really played it just for speed. Increasing my coding speed was one of my main goals, but at all times I tried to keep the code clean, readable and have a good separation of concerns. I might have slacked out sometimes when I spent a lot of time on the problem because I was happy to just get it done, but I'll likely refactor the code I don't fancy. There will be a link to the original solutions anyway for each problem.
 
Below you can find a summary of all the contest's problems. The folders contain my own solutions to these problems, and each readme has some notes I found interesting. I did every problem myself, without looking for any hints or inspirations (aside looking up some basic techniques like backtracking to refresh the concepts), so the solutions may not be optimal, but I'm happy all of them ran in a good amount of time.
